            <p>
                I am currently a sophomore at the University of Washington Bothell studying Computer Science &
                Software Engineering. I am looking forward to build onto my foundation and expanding into areas 
                that involve product vision and developing.

                I'm a big fan of sports especially basketball. I've been playing basketball since I was 5 years old. You
                can always catch me at LA Fitness shooting some ball. As you can see from the photo, I am a big Lakers fan.
                The mural was painted by Los Angeles artist <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/gz.jr/?hl=en"><strong>Gustavo Zerme√±o Jr.</strong></a> 
                when LeBron James just signed with the Lakers.

                I've been gaming since I was a little kid. My gaming journey all started with a Nintendo 64. When I was given
                Super Mario 64, I was hooked. Ever since then, I've been playing video games. Recently, I've had the chance in playing
                Warzone and Valorant which have turned out to be very enjoyable games during the quarantine. 
            </p>

            <p>Here are some of the music artists I listen to:</p>

                During the quarantine, I've been catching up on a lot of TV shows. I recently started watching a show on
                Netflix called <em>Trailer Park Boys.</em> If you are into comedy I would totally recommend this show to you.

            <h3>What I want to learn</h3> 
            <p>
                Having the opportunity to learn languages such as Java, C#, & C++, learning HTML and CSS was something I've always wanted to learn. When I was selecting courses
                for this quarter, I was so glad that UWB offered a class that highlighted the basics of HTML and CSS. With the skills
                I learned from this class, I hope to make a basic website in the future to showcase some of my work from my classes taken
                here at UWB.
